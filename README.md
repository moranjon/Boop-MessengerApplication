# Overview

Our application is a messenger app that will allow users to create an account, login, and send messages to a single or multiple users â€” privately and publicly. Users will be able to add friends (or contacts) in order to communicate. They'll be able to send audio and images to each other while chatting.

_(Start from Sprint 0, keep updating)_

## User Requirements

- Users will login using a username and password which will give them access to their account
- Once loggined into their account users can send messages into private or public chats
- Users will be notified of the typing status of their recipients
- Users can delete messages
- Users can create groups/rooms of desired recipients

## Use cases

User create account- When using the messenger application, the first page is the user login page. The user login page will consist of two text boxes and two buttons, one for username, one for password, a button to submit credentials, and a button to create a new user. If the credentials are accepted using the new user button, the user will be taken to the main messenger page.

# Implementation

_(Start from Sprint 1, keep updating)_

For each new sprint cycle, update the implementation of your system (break it down into subsections). It is helpful if you can include some code snippets to illustrate the implementation

Specify the development approach of your team, including programming languages, database, development, testing, and deployment environments. 


## Deployment

Describe how to deploy your system in a specific platform.

# Software Process Management

_(Start from Sprint 0, keep updating)_

Jon Moran will serve as scrum manager this sprint. All use cases and tasks are on a trello board and we divided up the task so that everyone has something to complete each week. Everyday at our weekly meeting we discuss any stoppages or if any one needs any help completing their tasks.

![Trello](https://trello.com/1/cards/614e2c380e369754e8c2655d/attachments/614e2c5ddf9d6840a5de66bc/previews/614e2c5edf9d6840a5de66fb/download/Screenshot_(134).png)


Trello Board Cards were created by team members with each use case serving as a card. In addition there is a goal for when we should complete each task. The goal timelines is more easily veiwed in the Gantt chart below. Once someone begins a task it will be moved to in progress and then upon completion moved to the completed list of the corresponding sprint.
Also, include the Gantt chart reflects the timeline from the Trello board. _(Main focus of Sprint 0)_

Each task is in a certain order. The basic steps are first so that we can build off of them for a future task. Each task is scheduled for a week and each team member was assigned a task to do that week. Timeline is subject to change if need be. 


## Scrum process

#### Sprint Retrospective:

_(Introduction to Sprint Retrospective:


Sprint 0 was a really great experience for all of us. It not only introduced to Agile Development and how to plan/develop a sophisticated project, but it showed us how to be professionally organized and work as a group. We were very efficient in planning, but we fell through when it came to maintaining that energy towards progressivley putting out plan into action (except the presentation).
Our retrospective meeting aided us in reflecting on our own indivudal performance through Sprint 0 and also our performance as a cooperative team.

#### Sprint Retrospective:

_(Introduction to Sprint Retrospective:

_Working through the sprints is a continuous improvement process. Discussing the sprint has just completed can improve the next sprints walk through a much efficient one. Sprint retrospection is done once a sprint is finished and the team is ready to start another sprint planning meeting. This discussion can take up to 1 hour depending on the ideal team size of 6 members. 
Discussing good things happened during the sprint can improve the team's morale, good team-collaboration, appreciating someone who did a fantastic job to solve a blocker issue, work well-organized, helping someone in need. This is to improve the team's confidence and keep them motivated.
As a team, we can discuss what has gone wrong during the sprint and come-up with improvement points for the next sprints. Few points can be like, need to manage time well, need to prioritize the tasks properly and finish a task in time, incorrect design lead to multiple reviews and that wasted time during the sprint, team meetings were too long which consumed most of the effective work hours. We can mention every problem is in the sprint which is hindering the progress.
Finally, this meeting should improve your next sprint drastically and understand the team dynamics well. Mention the bullet points and discuss how to solve it.)_
